--- Dataset description ---

Each object (car wheel and tire) is described by its bounding box and five keypoints.

Annotations for each image contain:
- coordinates of bounding boxes (each object has a bounding box, which is described with top left and bottom right corners in [x1, y1, x2, y2] format)
- coordinates of keypoints (each object has 5 keypoints, which are described in [x, y, visibility] format)

First keypoint - top of car wheel
Second keypoint - bottom of car wheel
Third keypoint - right side of car wheel (closest side, if car's left side wheels are being detected, the images should be mirrored, refer to treadscan.extractor.CameraPosition)
Fourth keypoint - top of tire, gives the sidewall height (calculated as difference between top of wheel and top of tire)
Fifth keypoint - point on the inner (right) side of tire, allows to calculate a more precise measurement for tread extraction
